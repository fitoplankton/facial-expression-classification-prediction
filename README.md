# Face-Expression-Classification-and-Prediction

This project is designed for **facial expression classification** from static image files.  
The system extracts features from uploaded face images using **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**, **OD-LBP (Orthogonal Difference Local Binary Pattern)**, and applies **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction.  
Classification is performed with **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**, and the trained model is integrated into a web application where users can upload an image to get the predicted facial expression.

üìä Model Training

- Models are trained using facial expression datasets with labeled images.
- Features are extracted using HOG / OD-LBP.
- PCA is applied to reduce feature dimensionality for efficiency.
- SVM is used as the main classifier.
- Trained models are saved in .pkl format to be used directly in the application.

üìù Notes

- The web application only supports image uploads (not real-time webcam input).
- If you use a new dataset, retrain the model and save the new PCA & SVM models into the new_models/ directory.
- Ensure the number of features during training matches those during prediction (to avoid PCA mismatch errors).
